      <li><b>1944-</b><span></span> Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant patology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
      <li><b>1945-</b><span></span> Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,doubling wheat yields</li>
      <li><b>1953-</b><span></span> crosses a short, study dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</li>
      <li><b>1962-</b><span></span> Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>

Says that Gm crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
      <li><b>2009-</b><span></span> Dies at the age of 95.</li>
    </ul>
